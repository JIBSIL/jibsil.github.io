title: Will it run - Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi 2b
---

Kano - Powered by the Raspberry Pi 2B. Probably the worst $150 that can be spent. In hindsight, a 512mb computer that runs at a *700 MHz* base clock probably wasn't such a good idea for any sort of GUI application. I had no idea how to overclock at the time, so I was left with a bulky case and a "computer" that is only useful as a paperweight. However, I'll save that rant for another day. It looks as if I finally have found a use for this excuse for a computer. Today, I am going to be sharing my experience with using the Raspberry Pi 2B for a Nextcloud server.
