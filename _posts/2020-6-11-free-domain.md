Free domains from A to Z - the good, the bad and the ugly. Featuring subdomains, .com domains and other free domains!

Free domains are everywhere! However, things can be hard when trying to get Top Level Domains (TLDs). After months of looking for a free domain service, here are the services - and the problems associated with these services.

# 1. [Freenom](https://freenom.com)
Freenom is a big contender in the free domain market. They will give you what's known as a ccTLD - a country code top level domain. These are countries who allow Freenom to use their country code domain. For example, one of the free endings they offer is the .tk ending. This country code belongs to the country of Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand. They offer .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf and .gq domains. They will actually give you a domain - free of charge, no credit card required. However, they have been known to suspend domains with a moderate amount of traffic, saying that it is "fraud", displaying ads on it and selling it to the highest bidder.
